To modify the code for better readability and to ensure the pie chart is displayed correctly, you can adjust the theme settings and add labels. Here is the updated code:

R

ggplot(total_expenses_by_category, aes(x = "", y = total_amount, fill = feature_category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") 
  +labs(title = "Expense Distribution by Category", x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(total_amount / sum(total_amount) * 100, 1), "%")), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))

This code will create a pie chart with percentage labels for each category, making it easier to interpret the distribution of expenses.

Modify the code and make unit name on x axis to vertical

To modify the code so that the unit names on the x-axis are displayed vertically, you can use the theme function in ggplot2 to adjust the text angle. Here is the updated code:

R

ggplot(total_expenses_by_unit, aes(x = reorder(unit_name, -total_amount), y = total_amount)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Expenses by Unit", x = "Unit Name", y = "Total Amount") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

This code will rotate the x-axis labels to be vertical, making them easier to read if they are long. The hjust = 1 ensures that the labels are right-aligned.
