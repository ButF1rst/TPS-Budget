abstract: "This dataset includes a line-by-line breakdown of the Toronto Police Serviceâ€™s approved budget at a Service-wide level in 2023. It details how funds are allocated across various organizations within the TPS. The analysis reveals a significant investment in personnel costs and operating expenses, highlighting the financial priorities of the police department. The findings provide insights into the financial planning and resource allocation strategies of the TPS, which are important for ensuring effective community safety."

# Introduction

In recent years, public scrutiny of police budgets has increased, driven by demands for greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. Effective financial management is essential for public safety organizations to ensure that they achieve their operational goals and serve their communities efficiently. The Toronto Police Service (TPS), as one of the largest municipal police forces in Canada, plays a critical role in maintaining public safety and order. Its budget reflects the complexity and scope of its operations. However, the allocation of its large budget is often the subject of debate among policymakers, community leaders, and the public. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the 2023 approved budget for the TPS, with a detailed breakdown of expenditures by organizations, categories, and cost elements.

The TPS budget is categorized into several key areas, including salaries, benefits, materials, services, and equipment. Each category is further divided to reflect the specific needs and priorities of different departments within the TPS. An important gap in the current discussion is the lack of detailed, accessible information on police budget structures and expenditures. The analysis addresses the gap by breaking down the budget into various components to provide a transparent view of where and how resources are allocated. By examining these allocations, we aim to provide a clear picture of financial priorities and operational strategies of the TPS and how these translate into operational effectiveness and community safety outcomes.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data



# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"),
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) +
  coord_flip()
```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

  ggplot(aes(x = width, y = length)) +

  labs(x = "Wing width (mm)",
       y = "Wing length (mm)")

Talk way more about it. 



# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.
